The error log contains multiple numbers, including but not limited to: 6000 (port, multiple occurrences), 61 (Errno, multiple occurrences), 127, 0, 0, 1 (from 127.0.0.1), 1 (from ::1), 0, 0 (additional IPv6 tuple values), 3.10 (Python version), 1268 (line number), 141 (line number), and 99 (line number). Units and contexts include port numbers and error codes.\n\nStep 3: Normalize formatting. IP address components are treated as numeric tokens (127, 0, 0, 1). The decimal 3.10 is preserved as 3.10. Port 6000 and Errno 61 are straightforward integers.\n\nStep 4: Compare with the agent's answer. There is no agent answer provided; therefore, all expected numbers are missing from the agent's answer.\n\nStep 5: Apply scoring rule. The instructions state to score 1.0 (TRUE) only if ALL numbers match exactly, and 0.0 (FALSE) if any number is wrong or missing. Since the agent's answer is missing entirely, all numbers are missing.

Here, the expected outcome appears to be the user-provided error log, but no agent answer is provided to compare against.\n\nStep 2: Extract numbers from the expected outcome. The error log contains multiple numbers, including but not limited to: 6000 (port, multiple occurrences), 61 (Errno, multiple occurrences), 127, 0, 0, 1 (from 127.0.0.1), 1 (from ::1), 0, 0 (additional IPv6 tuple values), 3.10 (Python version), 1268 (line number), 141 (line number), and 99 (line number). Units and contexts include port numbers and error codes.\n\nStep 3: Normalize formatting. IP address components are treated as numeric tokens (127, 0, 0, 1). The decimal 3.10 is preserved as 3.10. Port 6000 and Errno 61 are straightforward integers.\n\nStep 4: Compare with the agent's answer. There is no agent answer provided; therefore, all expected numbers are missing from the agent's answer.\n\nStep 5: Apply scoring rule.
