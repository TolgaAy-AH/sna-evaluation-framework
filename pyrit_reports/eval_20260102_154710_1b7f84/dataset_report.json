Key uncertainties include what service is expected to be running on port 6000, whether SSL should be enabled, the environment setup, and the intended troubleshooting scope. There is also ambiguity in the connector configuration (is_ssl=False while ssl=True) and whether IPv6/IPv4 should be used. Next, check whether the assistant's answer addresses these ambiguities by stating assumptions or clarifying interpretations. In this case, no assistant answer is provided to review. Since the prompt is ambiguous and no assumptions or clarifications are stated, the criteria for transparency are not met. Therefore, the correct score is 0.0.",
