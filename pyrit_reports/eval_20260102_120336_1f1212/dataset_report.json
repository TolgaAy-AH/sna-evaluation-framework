The table hive_metastore.analytics_assistant.product_week_channel_kpis appears appropriate for sales KPIs at a product-week-channel granularity, and summing Sales for the quarter across all rows is a valid approach to return total sales. The second query provides the overall total, and the first query provides a channel breakdown consistent with a GROUP BY ChannelKey, Channel.\n\nPart 2 \u2013 Citations: The answer explicitly cites the source table in the narrative (\u201cAccording to the hive_metastore.analytics_assistant.product_week_channel_kpis table...\u201d) and reiterates it in the Data Source section.

The answer explicitly states key assumptions: it maps Q3 2024 to QuarterKey = 202403 (clarifying the time-period interpretation), specifies aggregation across all units/categories/brands/products/channels (clarifying scope), and states that it sums the Sales field from a specific table (clarifying the metric source and field used). It also notes no data completeness check was needed due to historical period. The answer provides SQL that concretely shows the interpretation applied. While it does not explicitly discuss whether Sales is gross vs. net or define currency beyond using the euro symbol, it still transparently ties the result to a specific data field and table, making its chosen interpretation clear. Therefore, the response meets the criterion of explicitly stating assumptions in the presence of ambiguities.",

The table hive_metastore.analytics_assistant.product_week_channel_kpis appears appropriate for sales KPIs at a product-week-channel granularity, and summing Sales for the quarter across all rows is a valid approach to return total sales. The second query provides the overall total, and the first query provides a channel breakdown consistent with a GROUP BY ChannelKey, Channel.\n\nPart 2 \u2013 Citations: The answer explicitly cites the source table in the narrative (\u201cAccording to the hive_metastore.analytics_assistant.product_week_channel_kpis table...\u201d) and reiterates it in the Data Source section.
