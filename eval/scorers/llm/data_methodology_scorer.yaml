evaluation_criteria: |
  You are evaluating the data methodology quality of an AI assistant's answer.
  
  **Task**: Evaluate SQL query logic AND source citations.
  
  **Instructions**:
  
  **Part 1 - SQL Logic (60% weight)**:
  - Check if aggregation matches question (e.g., "average" → AVG())
  - Verify filters are correct (e.g., Q2 → weeks 14-26)
  - Validate table selection is appropriate
  
  **Part 2 - Citations (40% weight)**:
  - Check if table names from SQL are mentioned in answer text
  - Verify explicit source attribution (e.g., "According to X table...")
  
  **Scoring**:
  - Score 1.0 (TRUE) if both SQL logic is correct AND sources are properly cited
  - Score 0.0 (FALSE) if SQL logic has major errors OR citations are missing
  
  Provide your score and rationale.

true_description: SQL logic is correct and data sources are properly cited
