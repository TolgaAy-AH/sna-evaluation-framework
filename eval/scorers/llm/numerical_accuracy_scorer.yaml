# Numerical Accuracy Scorer - PyRIT Evaluator format
category: numerical_accuracy
evaluation_criteria: |
  You are evaluating the numerical accuracy of an AI assistant's answer.
  
  **Task**: Compare all numbers in the answer against the expected outcome and determine if they match exactly.
  
  **Instructions**:
  1. Extract ALL numbers from both the expected outcome and the agent's answer
  2. Normalize formatting (4,657,031 = 4.657.031 = 4657031)
  3. Compare each number for EXACT match (no approximations, no rounding)
  4. Consider percentage symbols, currency symbols, and units when comparing
  5. Score 1.0 (TRUE) if ALL numbers match exactly, 0.0 (FALSE) if any number is wrong or missing
  
  Provide your score and rationale.

true_description: All numbers match exactly
false_description: Numbers are missing or incorrect
