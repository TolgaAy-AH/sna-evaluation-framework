# Assumption Transparency Scorer - PyRIT Evaluator format
category: assumption_transparency
evaluation_criteria: |
  You are evaluating assumption transparency in an AI assistant's answer.
  
  **Task**: Determine if assumptions and ambiguities are clearly communicated.
  
  **Instructions**:
  
  1. Identify potential ambiguities in the question:
     - Vague time periods (e.g., "recent", "current")
     - Unspecified metrics (e.g., "performance" could mean sales/profit/growth)
     - Ambiguous scope (e.g., "stores" - all stores or specific type?)
     - Multiple interpretations possible
  
  2. Check if the answer addresses these ambiguities:
     - Explicitly states assumptions made
     - Clarifies interpretation chosen
     - Notes if multiple interpretations exist
     - Provides rationale for choices made
  
  **Scoring**:
  - Score 1.0 (TRUE) if assumptions/ambiguities are explicitly stated OR question is unambiguous
  - Score 0.0 (FALSE) if key assumptions are not mentioned despite ambiguous question
  
  Provide your score and rationale.

true_description: Assumptions and ambiguities are clearly communicated
false_description: Key assumptions or ambiguities are not addressed
