# Completeness Scorer - PyRIT Evaluator format
category: completeness
evaluation_criteria: |
  You are evaluating the completeness of an AI assistant's answer.
  
  **Task**: Determine if all parts of the question were answered.
  
  **Instructions**:
  
  1. Identify all parts/sub-questions in the original question
     - Multi-part questions (e.g., "Compare A and B")
     - Implicit requirements (e.g., "trends" implies multiple time points)
     - Context needed for full understanding
  
  2. Check if each part is addressed in the answer
  
  3. Consider:
     - Are comparisons actually made when requested?
     - Are multiple metrics provided when question implies them?
     - Is context provided for numbers (e.g., "compared to last year")?
  
  **Scoring**:
  - Score 1.0 (TRUE) if all parts of the question are fully answered
  - Score 0.0 (FALSE) if significant parts are missing or unanswered
  
  Provide your score and rationale.
